        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Qingrun Zhang, Dr. Quan Long, and Dr. Jingjing Wu at the University of Calgary.
            We are interested in implying machine learning and deep learning technique to extract features from medical images and then analysis with genomic data.
        </p>
        <p>
            I received my Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the University of Calgary in May 2021.
            Under the supervision of Dr. Michael Lamoureux and Dr. Wenyuan Liao, I worked on designing novel algorithms for PDE-constrained optimization problems.
            The main application scenario is the seismic imaging problem or so-called full-waveform inversion.
        </p>
